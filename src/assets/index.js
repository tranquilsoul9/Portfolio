export const HERO_CONTENT = `At 19, I'm all about tech â€“ it's my playground and my passion. I'm a natural learner, so diving into new coding languages like C++, Python, and JavaScript is like cracking open a good mystery novel. My enthusiasm for technology drives me to explore various fields, from software engineering to cybersecurity. The challenge of crafting intuitive solutions and solving complex problems is super exciting, and my learning curve is practically vertical. Give me a coding problem, and I'll be itching to solve it with an innovative approach!"`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I'm a highly motivated student with a strong foundation in C++ and a passion for exploring new technologies. In addition to C++, I've delved into C, Python, JavaScript, and Node.js, further expanding my programming skillset. I'm also eager to learn and excel in app development, actively pursuing Android development using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. My passion for innovation extends beyond the classroom; participating in challenges like Walmart CodeHers 2025 (where I was a finalist) and the Adobe GenSolve Solution Challenge (achieving top 5%) has not only honed my leadership and teamwork skills but has also led me to win several competitions! My experience as a PR Executive for Asmita and Director Secretary General for IIITA MUN'24, alongside conducting TEDx events and winning debates, further highlights my dedication to leadership, communication, and effective teamwork.`;
